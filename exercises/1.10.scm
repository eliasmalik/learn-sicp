; Exercise 1.10.

; The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's
; function.

(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

; What are the values of the following expressions?

; (A 1 10)
; (A (- 1 1) (A 1 (- 10 1)))
; (A 0 (A 1 9))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 6)))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 5))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 4)))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 3))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 1))))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 16))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 32)))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 64))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 128)))
; (A 0 (A 0 256))
; (A 0 512)
; prints Value: 1024 (which is 2^10)
(A 1 10)

; (A 2 4)
; (A 1 (A 2 3))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 0 2)))
; (A 1 (A 1 4))
; (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
; (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
; (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1)))))
; (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2))))
; (A 1 (A 0 (A 0 4)))
; (A 1 (A 0 8))
; (A 1 16)
; (A 0 (A 1 15))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 14)))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 13))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 12)))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 11))))))
; ....
; Actually we can shortcut all of this, because we know that (A 1 N) === 2^N
; So:
; (A 2 4)
; (A 1 16)
; prints Value: 65536 === 2^16 ==== 2^(2^4) === 2^(2^(2^2))
(A 2 4)

; (A 3 3)
; (A 2 (A 3 2))
; (A 2 (A 2 (A 3 1)))
; (A 2 (A 2 2))
; (A 2 4)
; prints Value: 65536
(A 3 3)

; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

(define (f n) (A 0 n))

(define (g n) (A 1 n))

(define (h n) (A 2 n))

(define (k n) (* 5 n n))

; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n)
; computes 5n^2.

; f :: n -> 2n   (multiplication)
; g :: n -> 2^n  (exponentiation)
; h :: n -> 2^^n (tetration)

; Ackermann's function is related to Knuth's up-arrow notation and the idea of
; hyperoperations
